# **UNEMPLOYMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-PYTHON**
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.


**Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate in India using data science techniques. The unemployment rate is a critical economic indicator that reflects the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. Analyzing the unemployment rate, especially during significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic, can provide valuable insights into the economic impact and help in policy-making decisions.

**Solution**
To achieve the objective, the solution involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather datasets containing unemployment rates and related economic indicators.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns.
4. Data Visualization: Visualize the data using various plots and charts to gain insights.
5. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between different economic indicators.
6. Conclusion: Summarize the findings and provide insights based on the analysis.

**Datasets**
1. Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv
2. Unemployment in India.csv

**Procedure**
Step 1: Data Collection
The data used in this project includes two CSV files:
1. Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv
2. Unemployment in India.csv
   
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Load the Data: Use pandas to load the CSV files into DataFrames.
Inspect the Data: Display the first few rows and check the structure of the data.
Check for Missing Values: Identify any missing values in the datasets.
Clean the Data: Strip leading/trailing spaces from column names and date values.
Convert Data Types: Convert date columns to datetime format and ensure consistency in column names and data types.

Step 3: Data Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics for the unemployment rates.
Trend Analysis: Analyze the trend of unemployment rates over time using line plots.
Regional Analysis: Analyze regional unemployment rates using bar plots.
Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between different economic indicators using heatmaps.

Step 4: Data Visualization
Visualize the data using seaborn and matplotlib to create line plots, bar plots, and heatmaps.

Step 5: Conclusion
Summarize the findings from the analysis and provide insights into the trends and patterns observed in the unemployment rates.

**Theory and Algorithms**
Unemployment Rate
Unemployment Rate=( Total Labor Force/Number of Unemployed People)×100

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data, often with visual methods. It helps in understanding the distribution, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies.

Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis is used to evaluate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where:

1. 1 indicates a strong positive relationship,
2. -1 indicates a strong negative relationship,
3. 0 indicates no relationship.

**Conclusion**
In this project, we analyzed the unemployment rate in India using data from two datasets. We performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to understand the trends and patterns in the unemployment rate over time and across regions. The analysis revealed significant insights into the impact of events like the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment. The correlation analysis provided additional insights into the relationships between various economic indicators. This analysis can help policymakers and economists make informed decisions to address unemployment issues.
